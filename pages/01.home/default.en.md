#### FAQ

- **How do I contribute?**
<br>That's pretty simple if you know how Github works. First, you would need to fork the repository and make a new file following the wiki page template. 
<br>Then all you have to do is make a pull request. Still don't know how to do it?

- **Can I add a half-finished page, because I don't know more?**
<br>Technically, yes. As long as it makes sense that should be fine, you don't have to explain all options available for that exact file.
<br>The entire point of this website is to collect as much information as possible.

- **Do I have to do all the markdown for the page?**
<br>Not really, I can take care of it.

- **I've found a mistake.**
<br>Please open an issue with the correct template [here](https://github.com/HeavyWolfPL/GTAV-Modding-isnt-Hard/issues).
